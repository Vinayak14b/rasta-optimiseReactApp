						How will our AI create base maps with road condition
						segments?{' '}
					</p>
					There are a couple of ways to build base maps with road
					conditions, such as mobile application-based surveys and
					enterprise surveys. The enterprise methodology captures
					360-degree panoramic street imagery by using high-definition
					cameras. This enables a comprehensive representation of the
					surrounding assets, encroachments, and road conditions. The
					data is useful for inventory management and complete virtual
					inspections, but it must be gathered by professionals with
					the appropriate training. Site engineers use mobile
					photographs in mobile application-based surveys to evaluate
					road conditions in real-time; this method provides fewer
					data points but better accessibility for rapid evaluations
					and decision-making.

				<div>
					<p className="text-blue-800 text-xl font-bold">
						Geo-Tagged Map of Road Conditions for Better Maintenance
						Planning
					</p>{' '}
					The exact condition of the roads will be captured, and
					processed data will be segregated and geo-tagged into
					different condition layers. This allows for a clear
					assessment of road quality, enabling the identification of
					priority areas for maintenance and repair. By organizing
					data based on condition, decision-makers can efficiently
					allocate resources and focus on the most critical areas that
					require attention. This structured approach improves the
					management and upkeep of road networks.

						Principal Used
					</p>
					<p>
						The roughness index is a key part of road condition
						monitoring. The IRI is calculated from the road profile.
						This profile can be measured in several different ways.
						The most common measurements are with Class 1
						instruments, capable of directly measuring the road
						profile, and Class 3 instruments, which use correlation
						equations.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Using World Bank terminology, these correspond to
						Information Quality Level (IQL) 1 and IQL-3 devices,
						representing the relative accuracy of the measurements.
						A common misconception is that the 80 km/h used in the
						simulation must also be used when physically measuring
						roughness with an instrumented vehicle. IQL-1 systems
						measure the profile direction, independent of speed, and
						IQL-3 systems typically have correlation equations for
						different speeds to relate the actual measurements to
						IRI.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						IQL-1 systems typically report the roughness at 10â20 m
						intervals; IQL-3 at 100 m+ intervals.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Early measurements were done with a rod-and-level survey
						technique. The Transportation Research Laboratory
						developed a beam which had a vertical displacement
						transducer. From the late 1990s on, the use of the
						dipstick profiler with a reported accuracy of 0.01 mm
						(0.0004 inches) became quite common.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Dynamic measurements of the road profile are done with
						vehicle-mounted instruments. The approach consisted of a
						sensor (initially ultrasonic but later laser), which
						measures the height of the vehicle relative to the road.
						An accelerometer is double-integrated to give the height
						of the sensor relative to the datum. The difference
						between the two is the elevation profile of the road.
						This elevation profile is then processed to obtain the
						IRI.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div className="page-breaks">
				<div>
					<p>
						The most common approaches see the IRI measured in each
						wheel path. The wheel path IRIs needs to be combined to
						obtain the overall IRI "roughness profile". There are
						two ways this can be done. A 'half-car' model simulates
						the vehicle travelling along both wheel paths, while a
						'quarter-car' model simulates one wheel on each wheel
						path, and the average is the lane IRI. The quarter-car
						approach is considered more accurate in representing the
						motion felt by users and so is most common.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Less expensive alternatives to profile meters are
						RTRRMS, which do not record the profile but rather are
						installed in vehicles and measure how the vehicle
						responds to the pavement profile. These need to be
						calibrated against IRI to obtain an estimate of the IRI.
						Since RTRRMS are generally affected by pavement texture
						and speed, it is common to have different calibration
						equations to correct the readings for these effects. RTRRMS can be grouped into three broad categories and
						are generally IQL-3, except arguably most cell
						phone-based systems, which are IQL-4.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Bump Integrators, single wheel: These have a physical
						connection between the sprung and unsprung mass and
						record the relative motion. Originally trailer-mounted,
						such as the one developed in India by CRRI, CRRI Trailer
						Bump Integrator, they are now most commonly installed on
						the floor of a vehicle with a cable connecting to the
						suspension. These type of instruments typically suffer from manual
						errors due to manual data collection of the bumps while
						riding in the car (field engineer takes count of number
						of bumps using pen and paper in a running vehicle every
						one kilometre) and requirement to calibrate the hardware
						system at centralized calibration facility due to
						mechanics permanently attached to the vehicle needing
						physical adjustments (not software- driven) for every
						change in vehicle behaviour
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Accelerometer-Based Systems: These use an accelerometer
						to measure the relative motion of the sprung mass, which
						is sometimes corrected for the unsprang mass.

						Calibration
					</p>
					<p>
						Calibration is the most important part of equipment
						tuning and is required to get the right IRI
						(International Roughness Index) estimations from running
						vehicles every time, so to compare multiple results
						using the same baseline,
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Calibration of Class-III instruments (Response Type Road
						Roughness Measurement Systems) require considering
						following major issues:

						<p className="text-blue-800 font-bold text-xl">
							Mechanical
						</p>
						<p>
							Since the data collection device is mechanical and
							is permanently attached to the vehicle, the
							calibration settings of this system are achieved
							through the right tuning of mechanical parts, like
							the length of the cable from the axel to the bump
							recording machine. E.g., for measurement of bumps
							amounting to 6mm of vehicle movement, the
							axel-mounted cable system needs to be adjusted to 6
							mm of movement of the metal wire to trigger a bump
							in the recording system. Also, the bump recording
							equipment needs to be fine-tuned for the current
							health of the vehicle suspension system based on its
							fitness and NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness)
							ratios.
